// What is JSON

/*
JSON stands for JavaScript Object notation - it's a lightweight format for storing and transferring data between a client and a server

JSON is the universal language of data interchange in modern computing 
It's lightweight, human readable, and machine-parsable. 
Every major programming language (Python , Java,GO,Rust,etc.) can parse and generate JSON easily.

Universal format(used in 99% APIs)

No need for extra encoding/decoding layers

It looks like javaScript objects but is actually a text foramt.
